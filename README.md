# A-P-I-BootCamp
In this exercise you will code some simple API requests to a API containg a couple of different data types. The focus here is just to get to know the fetch API built-in in JavaScript

Exercise 1:
Request all the pokemons with fetch from the API.
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/pokemons.json
Render the objects one and one in the console.

Render the name of the objects in the DOM instead of the console to make it visible for the user.

Exercise 2:
Request all the dogs with fetch from the API.
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/dogs.json
Render the names of the dogs one and one in the console.

Render them out in the DOM instead of the console.

Exercise 3:
Request all the books from the API.
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/books.json
Render all the books to the DOM that have less pages than 500.
Exercise 4:
Request all the visitors to a work-event from the API.
https://majazocom.github.io/Data/attendees.json
Render only the ones that are attending to the DOM.
attending: true
Render only the ones that are attending and have some allergy to the DOM.
